1)This is the solution for Question 1 in assignement. Please note that I did this windows 10 and hence some codes are added extra to make it compatible.

code is the following 

int main(void) {
	float number;
	setbuf(stdout,NULL);
	printf("enter the mark");
	scanf("%f",&number);
	if (number<50){
		printf("failed");}
	else printf("passed");
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}


output

enter the mark45
failed
